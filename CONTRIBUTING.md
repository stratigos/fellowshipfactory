## PRs

All code changes must come from a branch. All branches must be merged with `rebase` or `squash`, and approved via a PR by at least one other developer.

## Branching

It is strongly encouraged that all branches originate from a GH Isssue.

Name the branch with a prefix of the issue number and underscore, and then a description of the goal of the branch. For example, `64_add-user-pet-data`.

For branches without issues, prefex the branch with the author's/authors' initials. E.g., `tm_update-newsletter-form-ui` or `xyz_remove-news-link`.

For emergency fixes or hot patches that lack an issue, add the prefix `fix_`.
